# googleSheetTrack
A basic integration of Google apps script, sheets, and forms. Provides logic for adding and/or editing rows via forms.

Steps
1. Create a form and attach it to a sheet
2. Be sure that form allows for the editing of responses
3. Add the code to the sheets script editor
4. Set up a trigger to run addEditUrl on form submission. This will keep track of the form edit urls for us
5. Start tracking stuff!
